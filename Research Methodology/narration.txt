for the member consists of myself steven, jojo and ricky

now for the first ill explain the top left part first
we start from the background first
whats the background of our research why we choose this topic
are because
(LLMs) such as GPT are increasingly used to support scientific writing. However, these models are prone to hallucinations — the results may be fictitious, inaccurate, or unverifiable.

This becomes especially critical issue in academic contexts, where factual precision, valid references, and structural integrity are essential. Hallucinations in AI-generated content threaten the reliability and credibility of scientific research.

================================================================================
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the STORM framework (Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking) in minimizing hallucinations.
STORM is designed to enhance:

Factual Accuracy

Content Structure

Citation Reliability

STORM Framework Overview
The STORM pipeline simulates how human experts plan and write academic content:

It begins by identifying a topic and surveying existing literature.

It then gathers multiple perspectives and drafts an outline.

Through a multi-agent dialogue, a “writer” and “expert” agent exchange questions and answers based on retrieved sources.

These conversations help refine the outline, ensure balanced perspectives, and embed verified citations.

The diagram illustrates this interactive process, where trusted references and synthesized knowledge lead to a well-structured, fact-checked academic article.
